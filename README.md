## installation (Windows):
* copy dll from x64 folder (nvFlexDop_165.dll for houdini 16.5, nvFlexDop_160.dll for houdini 16.0) to any dso location, like for example into **C:\Users\\\<YOUR USER\>\Documents\houdini16.5\dso\\**
* copy all *.otl files from otls folder to your otls folder, like for example into **C:\Users\\\<YOUR USER\>\Documents\houdini16.5\otls\\**
* copy all *.dll files from dll folder to any path in your system PATH environment variable.
The most straightforward way would be to copy them into your **system32** folder, like **C:\Windows\system32\\** ,
but i would suggest to copy them into a new folder, for example **C:\mystuff\bin\nvflex\\** and add that path to system PATH variable. 
Please, see [here](https://superuser.com/questions/949560/how-do-i-set-system-environment-variables-in-windows-10) for instructions how to access environment variables.
just add your folder to the end of the **PATH** variable. So with example folder above it will looks like **\<CONTENT OF YOUR PATH VARIABLE\>;C:\mystuff\bin\nvflex\\**

## installation (Linux):
* copy so appropriate for your houdini version from **x64/linux64/dso** folder to your **\<home\>/houdini16.X/dso/** folder (create **dso** subfolder if necessary). These so were compiled with gcc 6.3.0, glibc 2.24-11.

* if you want to compile it yourself:
  * edit **linux_build_16X.sh** so the helper variables point to the locations of the libraries it requires
  * launch **linux_build_16X.sh** and if you have all dependencies - build will succeed, and your new so will be put into **x64/linux64/dso** folder
  * note: depending on your linux distribution you might require different packages. You might also require full Cuda Toolkit **8.0.44** to be able to build, in this case you will have to add paths to your Cuda toolkit to the Makefile. Although some distributions, like debian, have core libs from that toolkit available in reps, so for example for debian - package nvidia-cuda-dev will be enough and you don't have to download full Cuda Toolkit and set any paths manually.

That should do it.


If you encounter problems, like houdini crashes on startup or plugin not working in general: try [this work in progress branch](https://github.com/pedohorse/Houdini-NvFlex/tree/work-in-progress)

it will at least print out the problem into the console

If the plugin does not load and no console message is printed, but houdini itself launches - you probably forgot to make some of dlls from the **bin** folder available (see pt.3 of installation guide, and make sure you have microsoft vc 2015 redistributable installed (it would be fun if you don't cuz houdini needs it to launch as well))
